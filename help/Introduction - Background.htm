<img src="images/splash.bmp" alt="Splash image">
<p>In the Valley of the Great Sword stands a massive fortress. It serves as the refuge for the most powerful Mage in the world, X the Unknown. With the aid of an Orc army he has transformed tumble-down ruins into this, the strongest fort in existence. Once secure in the Citadel, however, the Mage betrayed the Free Peoples of the valley into the hands of the Empire during the Third War of the League of the Ararlve. The Empire rewarded him richly for his treachery. Since that time, the Mage's power has grown steadily, spreading throughout neighboring lands. However, his success to date is as nothing when compared to the darkness he is now prepared to loose. His possession of the ancient and powerful Hellgate now poses a threat to the Empire itself.</p>
<p><i>Citadel of Blood</i> represents a series of raids on X the Unknown's Citadel by a mixed force of Free People, representatives of the Empire, and mercanaries. The game is similar to many fantasy role-playing games, but requires no gamesmaster. The characters and premise of this game are taken from SPI's game, <i>Swords and Sorcery</i>.</p>
