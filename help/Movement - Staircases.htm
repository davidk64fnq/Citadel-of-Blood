<h1>Staircase</h1>
<p>The Citadel may be up to three levels in depth. Some room segments feature stairways. Each stairway connects all three levels. The Hellgate may be located on any one of the three levels. See the <A HREF="Movement - Mirrors.htm">mirrors topic</A> for help in locating the Hellgate. The characteristics of the monsters change and become more vile the deeper the party goes into the Citadel.</p>
<p>Movement between levels is is one level per turn and counts as entering a room segment. The usual procedures are carried out for each move into a staircase. So to move from level one to level two the party would first move into a staircase segment on level one. On the next turn clicking on the staircase segment would allow the party to move to the staircase segment directly beneath on level two.</p>
