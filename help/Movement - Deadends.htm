<h1>Deadends</h1>
<p>The Citadel maze may not end in a dead end until the Hellgate is located. If all possible exits out of the explored part of the Citadel lead to dead ends, then the computer randomly selects a bitmap close to the parties current location and changes a wall into a door exit. The altered bitmap is chosen adjacent to an unvisited location to allow further exploration of the Citadel.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> Remember that the Citadel extends over three levels. If there is a staircase then one of the other levels may still have exploration options.</p>
