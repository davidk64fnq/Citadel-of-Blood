<h1>General Rule</h1>
<p>In <i>Citadel of Blood</i>, there is no game map. Instead, the players construct a maze through which they move during the course of play by placing room and corridor chits (called segments) adjacent to each other. In this computer version the player clicks a location adjacent to the current party location, depicted by a bitmap with a yellow box outline on it, and the computer selects a random bitmap representing a chit. The party moves throught the Citadel one segment at a time.</p>
<p>Each time the party leaves a segment they commit to a direction by clicking on an adjacent location. The computer chooses a bitmap for the new location that matches the exit type of the parties current location and any previously visited locations adjacent to the new location.</p>
