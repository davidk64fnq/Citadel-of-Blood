<BODY>
<h1>Segment Rotation</h1>
<p>The bitmap is displayed in such a way that a doorway always abuts a doorway and a corridor always abuts a corridor. If the bitmap can be rotated and still fulfil these conditions then a pop-up menu is displayed to allow the user to do so.</p>
<img src="images/Rotation Popup.bmp" alt="Rotation Popup image">
<p>In the example above clicking on "Rotate Clockwise" would rotate the bitmap through 180 degrees and the doorway would then be on the north edge of the bitmap. There are two keyboard shortcuts available with the pop-up. The control key selects "Leave as is", the shift key selects "Rotate Clockwise". When the party enters a segment that has previously been entered, no new bitmap is selected.</p>
<p>The one time a party may move by clicking on their current location bitmap is when they start the turn on a staircase and intend to ascend or descend a level in the Citadel. See the <A HREF="Movement - Staircases.htm">staircases topic</A> for more detail on how staircases are utilised.</p>
