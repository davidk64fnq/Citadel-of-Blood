<h1>Victory Conditions</h1>
<p>There are two types of victory: team victory and character victory. In order for the team, meaning the characters as a group, to win, the Hellgate must be found and destroyed, and at least one of the characters must make it back out of the Citadel alive (to tell the world). In order for a character to win, he must get out of the Citadel alive, have gained at least 100 Experience Points, and gained at least 100 Gold Marks value in gold or jewels.</p>
<p>In any given game, the party may decide to leave the Citadel before the Hellgate is found and destroyed. In this case, team victory is impossible. In order to exit the Citadel (and thus the game), the party must get back to the first level and exit from the original segment which connects to the Gateway of Evil.</p>
