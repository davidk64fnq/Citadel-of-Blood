<h1>Hellgate</h1>
<p>The Hellgate is a large mountain-like device of tremendous magical power which the party must find and destroy in order to win the game. It is guarded by a number of bound demons and X the Unknown. Once the Hellgate is found there will be an extra Phase in the Combat Sequence called the Hellgate Phase. During this Phase the Hellgate will cast blast spells.</p>
<p>The party eneters the Citadel and looks for the Hellgate. If they decide at some point during play that they will be killed before they find it, they have the option to leave. Should they exit before they have found and destroyed the Hellgate, then the game may continue. The players may reeneter the Citadel after being cured of all wounds. The previously explored segments are left as is. Each time the characters leave the Citadel, they should check for character victory. See the <A HREF="Introduction - Victory Conditions.htm">victory conditions topic</A>.</p>
